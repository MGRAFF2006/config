# Laptop

Portable interactive workstation. User: `humunkulud`; OS: Arch Linux;
Tailscale identity: `laptop` (`100.66.24.27`). Use the established Tailscale name
for connections. The local hostname alone does not identify this device.

## Capabilities

Ryzen AI 7 350, Radeon 860M integrated GPU, about 30 GiB usable RAM. Prefer it for
interactive coding, research, review, and light checks. Battery, heat, travel,
and suspension matter more than its memory capacity. There is no locally
configured model runtime in this kit; cloud coding agents use their provider.

Verified on 2026-10-02: current session is Hyprland on Wayland. KDE Plasma is
also part of the documented setup; do not assume which session is running.

## AI tools and supporting services

Verified on 2026-10-02:

| Component | Observation |
| --- | --- |
| Codex on PATH | `~/.npm-global/bin/codex`, CLI version `0.160.0` |
| Arch Codex package | `openai-codex 0.155.1-1`; differs from the PATH executable |
| OpenCode on PATH | `~/.opencode/bin/opencode`, version `1.18.25` |
| Arch OpenCode package | `opencode 2.0.12-1`; differs from the PATH executable |
| T3 Code | `t3code-bin 0.0.38-1`, launched through `~/.local/bin/t3code` |
| Thunderbird MCP | Add-on 0.9.2 enabled; authenticated API verified on `127.0.0.1:8765` (40 tools). Source: `~/Projects/thunderbird-mcp`; Codex registration: `scripts/configure-thunderbird-mcp.sh`. Connection tokens stay machine-local. |
| Cursor | Desktop app and CLI uninstalled on 2026-10-02; removed from the package list and agent-kit installation targets |
| Supporting tools | Git, gh, SSH, rsync, tmux, Node, Bun, Python, shellcheck available |
| Tailscale | `tailscaled` active |
| Syncthing | User service active; `Documents/config` is a configured share |
| Agent kit | Installed; readiness check passed; OpenCode discovered the six initial shared skills; the shared kit now also includes ponytail |
| Codex authentication | CLI login status detected an authenticated session; no credentials copied |

If behavior differs from package documentation, check `command -v codex`,
`command -v opencode`, and their `--version` output first. Do not delete or
replace either installation without a concrete reason.

## Connections and paths

- Config and Fleet: `~/Documents/config/agent/`.
- Common work: `~/Documents/`; `~/Projects/` is also a configured Syncthing share.
- Desktop: `ssh desktop`; SSH configuration resolves to `100.65.78.19`, user
  `humunkulud`, port 22. Reachability was not available during setup.
- T3 launcher and campus proxy source: `home/.local/bin/t3code` and
  `home/.config/t3code-proxy/` in the config repo. The campus relay workaround
  depends on desktop reachability. Diagnose that dependency if it fails.
- Leave provider logins, SSH private keys, T3 connection catalogs, and agent
  session databases machine-local.

## Lid close and recovery

Configured on 2026-10-02 at Mathis's explicit request: `laptop-lid-awake.service`
blocks logind's lid-close suspend during the graphical session. Hyprland turns
the built-in `eDP-1` display off on lid close and on when opened. Manual sleep
remains available; suspend before putting the awake laptop in a bag.

A local tmux session does not prevent manual suspension, and a graphical agent
thread may lose its connection after sleep. When back, reopen/reconnect the app,
inspect `git status`, check any running processes, and tell the agent to resume
from the existing work.

If a task must continue while this laptop sleeps, use the desktop when it is
online and keep the job in tmux **on the desktop**.
